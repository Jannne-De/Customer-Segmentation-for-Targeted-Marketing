Customer-Segmentation-for-Targeted-Marketing
1. Introduction
Customer segmentation is crucial for businesses to optimize marketing strategies and improve customer retention. This project focuses on segmenting customers based on their purchasing behavior using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis and clustering techniques.
2. Data Cleaning and Preparation
2.1 Data Cleaning
Removed duplicate entries.
Handled missing values.
Converted necessary columns to numeric types.
2.2 Feature Engineering
RFM Metrics:
Recency: Days since the last purchase.
Frequency: Number of purchases made.
Monetary: Total spending of the customer.
Product Categorization:
Applied TF-IDF and Word2Vec for product descriptions.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Distribution of customers based on RFM metrics.
Identified top spending customers and their purchasing behavior.
Analyzed country-wise distribution of high-value customers.
4. Customer Segmentation
4.1 Clustering Techniques Used
K-Means Clustering:
Used Elbow Method and Silhouette Score to determine optimal clusters.
DBSCAN (Density-Based Clustering):
Identified outliers and noise in the data.
Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM):
Provided flexible clustering with probability-based membership.
4.2 Cluster Analysis
Visualized clusters using heatmaps and scatter plots.
Identified key customer segments:
Regular Customers
High-Value Customers (Enterprise & Wholesale Buyers)
Anomalous Buyers (Outliers)
5. Optimization for Machine Learning
Class Balancing: Merged small clusters for better model generalization.
Feature Scaling: Applied MinMaxScaler for consistent data distribution.
Train-Test Split: Stratified sampling to maintain class balance.
6. Next Steps
Apply classification models (e.g., RandomForest, XGBoost) to predict customer segment.
Implement recommendation algorithms for personalized marketing strategies.
7. Conclusion
This project successfully segments customers based on purchasing behavior, providing valuable insights for business decisions. Future work can integrate predictive modeling for enhanced marketing campaigns.
